```

This gradient represents the journey from **input** (people) to **outcome** (purpose).

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

1. **Review all 6 P's regularly** - Don't focus on one at the expense of others
2. **Use the framework for root cause analysis** - When something goes wrong, ask which P(s) contributed
3. **Align goals across P's** - Ensure PEOPLE goals support PROCESS goals, etc.
4. **Celebrate wins in each P** - Not just PROFIT wins
5. **Use data to inform decisions** - Each P has measurable KPIs

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Don't optimize one P in isolation** - Changes ripple across all P's
2. **Don't ignore PURPOSE** - It's easy to focus on metrics and forget mission
3. **Don't treat PEOPLE as a cost** - They're the foundation of everything
4. **Don't skimp on PLATFORM** - Poor tools create invisible costs
5. **Don't wait for perfect data** - Start measuring and improve over time
