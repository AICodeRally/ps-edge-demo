## Separation of Concerns

### PIPELINE vs PROFIT

- Deal probability weighting

**PROFIT = Actual dollars**
- Invoices issued
- Revenue recognized
- Cash collected
- Margins realized

**Example:**
- $500K campaign engagement in PIPELINE → Proposal stage (weighted 40% = $200K forecast)
- Same engagement in PROFIT (after contract signed) → $500K revenue recognized over 12 months

### PROCESS vs PRACTICE
**PROCESS = HOW (delivery execution)**
- Running active engagements
- Tracking deliverables
- Managing client communication
- Quality assurance

**PRACTICE = WHAT (service offerings)**
- 11 service lines we sell
- Methodologies we use
- Training we provide
- IP we develop

### PURPOSE vs PERFORMANCE
Both measure outcomes, but different lenses:

**PURPOSE = Mission outcomes**

**PERFORMANCE = Business outcomes**
