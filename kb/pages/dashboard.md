# Dashboard Overview

Welcome to your PS-Edge command center! This is your starting point for managing all professional services operations.

## Quick Start

The dashboard organizes everything around the **6 P's framework**:

1. **Purpose** - Mission alignment, client success, proposals
2. **People** - Team capacity, utilization, onboarding
3. **Process** - Engagements, deliverables, support, knowledge
4. **Product** - AI tools, integrations, data management
5. **Pipeline** - Sales pipeline, deals, revenue forecasting
6. **Performance** - Revenue tracking, timesheets, financial performance

## Navigation

Use the **footer links** to quickly jump between P categories. Each P has a landing page with quick access to its sub-pages.

## AI Assistants

Five AI orbs help you work smarter:

- **OpsChief** (bottom-left) - Business health insights
- **Pulse** (bottom-left) - Operational notifications
- **PageKB** (bottom-left) - Context-aware help (you're using it now!)
- **Tasks** (bottom-right) - Task management
- **AskPS** (bottom-right) - AI chat assistant

Toggle these in **Platform → Settings → AI Features** if needed for client demos.

## Getting Help

- **PageKB orb**: Context-specific help for each page
- **AskPS orb**: Ask questions in natural language
- **Settings**: Platform → Settings for customization

## Quick Tips

- Navbar shows **client name** (defaults to "DEMO Edge")
- Orange "Demo Data" badge indicates sample data
- All 6 P's accessible via footer on any page
- AI features respect client policies (can be disabled)
