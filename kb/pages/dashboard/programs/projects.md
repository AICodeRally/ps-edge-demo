# Project Management

Track implementation projects across all AFFCF programs.

## What Are Projects?

Projects are time-bound initiatives to implement or improve programs:
- **New program launches** - Keys to Success expansion
- **System improvements** - Case management software
- **Facility upgrades** - Classroom renovations
- **Curriculum development** - New life skills modules

## Current Projects

**Active:** 6 projects in progress
**On Track:** 4 (67%)
**At Risk:** 2 (33%)
**Average Progress:** 68%

## Project Tracking

### Milestones
Each project has 3-8 milestones:
- ✅ **Completed** - On schedule
- ⏱️ **In Progress** - Active work
- 📅 **Upcoming** - Not yet started

**Example: Tutoring Expansion Project**
1. ✅ Secure funding ($12K)
2. ✅ Recruit 2 additional tutors
3. ⏱️ Classroom setup and materials
4. 📅 Spring enrollment (Feb 1)
5. 📅 Program evaluation (May 1)

### Budget Monitoring

**Track Two Metrics:**
- **Project Progress** - % of work complete
- **Budget Utilization** - % of funds spent

**Ideal:** Spend ≈ Progress
**Warning:** Spending ahead of progress
**Concern:** Way behind on spending (delays?)

## Project Status Definitions

**On Track:**
- Meeting milestones
- Budget aligned with progress
- No blockers

**At Risk:**
- 1-2 weeks behind schedule
- Minor budget concerns
- Solvable blockers

**Behind:**
- >2 weeks behind
- Budget issues
- Major blockers

**Completed:**
- All milestones done
- Final report submitted
- Lessons learned documented

## Managing At-Risk Projects

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Identify root cause of delay
2. Update timeline or reduce scope
3. Reallocate resources if needed
4. Communicate with stakeholders
5. Document mitigation steps
